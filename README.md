# FBLA-Coding-Comp

When I was a sophomore in high school, I was a member of the Future Business Leaders of America. As part of this club, I attended a state-wide conference that involved several specialized competitions. These competitions varied across many subjects and disciplines, and each attendee chose one to compete in. I chose to try my hand at the Coding and Programming competition.

The task for the contest was to create a GUI interface for a Library (as in book distributor not a collection of code files). The user was to be able to input books, input students, assign books to students, and update any existing records. The data for students and books was to be stored in a relational database so it could be retrieved and modified each time the program ran.

I used this opportunity to learn and use Java's awt and swing libraries for event handling and GUI elements. I also decided to use a SQL database to store my project's data. This meant I could use Java's sql library to connect to my database and run queries via MySQL.

Final result: 2nd Place
